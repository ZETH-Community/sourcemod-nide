/**
 * @brief Clones a Handle.  When passing handles in between plugins, caching handles
 * can result in accidental invalidation when one plugin releases the Handle, or is its owner
 * is unloaded from memory.  To prevent this, the Handle may be "cloned" with a new owner.
 * 
 * @note Usually, you will be cloning Handles for other plugins.  This means that if you clone
 * the Handle without specifying the new owner, it will assume the identity of your original calling
 * plugin, which is not very useful.  You should either specify that the receiving plugin should
 * clone the handle on its own, or you should explicitly clone the Handle using the receiving plugin's
 * identity Handle.
 *
 * @param hndl		Handle to clone/duplicate.
 * @param plugin	Optional Handle to another plugin to mark as the new owner.
 *				If no owner is passed, the owner becomes the calling plugin.
 * @return		Handle on success, INVALID_HANDLE if not cloneable.
 * @error			Invalid handles will cause a run time error.
